# Writing Style Guide

Follow these guidelines for all written responses:

## Tone

- Professional but approachable
- Confident without being arrogant
- Helpful and solution-oriented

## Structure

- Lead with the most important information
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences)
- Use headings for responses longer than 200 words

## Language

- Prefer active voice over passive
- Avoid jargon unless the user uses it first
- Be concise: if you can say it in fewer words, do
- Use "you" to address the user directly

## Formatting

- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms
- Use `code formatting` for technical terms, commands, file names
- Use > blockquotes for important warnings or notes
